[[ jstest-gtk ]]
================

jstest-gtk is a simple joystick tester based on Gtk+. It provides you
with a list of attached joysticks as well as the ability to display
which buttons and axis are pressed.

You can find the latest version at:

 * http://github.com/Grumbel/jstest-gtk/tree/master


[[ Compiling ]]
===============

jstest-gtk uses SCons, you can compile it by typing:

 $ scons


[[ Usage ]]
===========

Once compiled you can start jstest-gtk with:

 $ ./jstest-gtk

or if you know the device you want to test with:

 $ ./jstest-gtk /dev/input/js0


[[ Usage/Test ]]
================

The Test-Tab provides a simple graphical representation of the
joystick and displays all the values of the axis and buttons.


[[ Usage/Settings ]]
====================

The Settings-Tab allows you to reorder the buttons and axis. This is
useful for example when a game expects the dpad to be on axis 0 and 1,
while in reality it is often on axis 4 and 5 on a dual-analogstick
gamepad.


[[ Usage/Calibration ]]
=======================

While most modern joysticks do not need to be calibrated, the
Calibration-Tab can still be useful, as it allows you to manipulate
some low level details on how the raw axis values are mapped to the
joystick device. For example you can inverse an axis, disable an axis
or remove its deadzone, to gain more fine control on small movements.
