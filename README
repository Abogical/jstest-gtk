[[ jstest-gtk ]]
================

jstest-gtk is a simple joystick tester based on Gtk+. It provides you
with a list of attached joysticks as well as the ability to display
which buttons and axis are pressed.

You can find the latest version at:

[[ Compiling ]]
===============

Make sure you have the following pieces of software installed:

 * scons
 * gtkmm

You can compile it by typing:

 $ scons


[[ Usage ]]
===========

Once compiled you can start jstest-gtk with:

 $ ./jstest-gtk

or if you know the device you want to test with:

 $ ./jstest-gtk /dev/input/js0

The main window will provide you with a list of currently available
joysticks. When you double click a joystick it will display the Test
dialog, allowing you to test buttons and axes on the joystick.

The mapping dialog allows you to reorder the buttons and axis. This is
useful for example when a game expects the dpad to be on axis 0 and 1,
while in reality it is often on axis 4 and 5 on a dual-analogstick
gamepad.

While most modern joysticks do not need to be calibrated, the
calibration dialog can still be useful, as it allows you to manipulate
some low level details on how the raw axis values are mapped to the
joystick device. For example you can inverse an axis, disable an axis
or remove its deadzone, to gain more fine control on small movements.
